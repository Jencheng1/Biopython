# Access Bioinformatics Databases with Biopython

Welcome to the **Access Bioinformatics Databases with Biopython** repository! This project showcases the use of Biopython to interact with various bioinformatics databases. The repository provides example scripts and Jupyter notebooks that guide you through accessing, retrieving, and analyzing data from popular databases in the field of bioinformatics.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Biopython Setup**  
   Install and set up Biopython, along with necessary dependencies, to access bioinformatics databases.

2. **Database Access**  
   Learn how to query and retrieve data from NCBI, UniProt, and other popular bioinformatics databases.

3. **Data Retrieval**  
   Work with different types of biological data, including sequences, annotations, and metadata, to support various bioinformatics analyses.

4. **Data Manipulation**  
   Use Biopython tools to parse, filter, and analyze retrieved data. Integrate with other Python libraries for extended data manipulation and visualization.
